# Call for Papers

[](**Please note that we have extended the paper submission deadline to August 12.**)
**Deadline for the standard submissions has passed. We accept papers published elsewhere for the non-archival track (deadline: September 3). Please submit your work via the [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPOCOr_4UiTVII29dZAL1GXkTFFvueQJa9gLaVK5TKh5R02A/viewform?usp=sf_link).**

We seek regular paper submissions on various aspects of machine reading systems for question answering, including but not limited to: accuracy, speed, scalability, robustness, dataset creation, dataset analysis, and error analysis. General MRQA submissions should be submitted to our research track.

Submissions related to MRQA 2021â€™s special themes of interpretability and multilinguality will be featured in two separate tracks. The interpretability track seeks submissions related to QA model introspection and explainability, including, but not limited to, topics such as rationales, attention, and model analysis. Our multilinguality track seeks submissions including, but not limited to, topics such as cross-lingual generalization, language transfer, datasets, and language-robust evaluation metrics.

## Submission guidelines
Submissions should be at least 4 and at most 8 pages, not including citations; final versions of papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages).  All submissions will be reviewed according to the same standards, regardless of length (i.e., there are no separate short and long paper tracks). Submissions may optionally include an appendix with no length restriction. The main paper must remain fully self-contained, as reviewers will not be asked to review appendices.  Please format your papers using the standard [style files for EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/call-for-papers/style-and-formatting).

We accept submissions of both previously unpublished work and work recently published elsewhere. Previously unpublished work must be anonymized, as it will go through a double-blind review process, and will be included in the workshop proceedings if accepted. Recently published work does not need to be anonymized and will not go through the review process. The submission should clearly indicate the original venue and will be accepted if the organizers think the work will benefit from exposure to the audience of this workshop. Work published elsewhere will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

This year, we are using a hybrid submission system: papers may be submitted either via the [Softconf START system](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/MRQA) or the [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/) system.
Submissions to the non-archival track can be submitted via the [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPOCOr_4UiTVII29dZAL1GXkTFFvueQJa9gLaVK5TKh5R02A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

#### Dual submissions
We allow submissions that are also under review in other venues, but please note that many conferences do not allow it, so make sure that you do not violate their policy as well.

#### Anonymity period
We do not enforce an anonymity period. We do not restrict posting on preprint servers such as arXiv at any point of time.
