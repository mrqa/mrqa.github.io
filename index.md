## Overview

Machine Reading for Question Answering (MRQA) has become an important testbed for evaluating how well computer systems understand human language, as well as a crucial technology for industry applications such as search engines and dialogue systems.
In a typical MRQA setting, a system must answer a question by reading one or more context documents.
Successful MRQA systems must understand a wide range of natural language phenomena, and a wide variety of question and document types.

## Themes of MRQA 2021
This year, our workshop will highlight two important themes: (1) multilingual and cross-lingual question answering, and (2) interpretability.
We have invited speakers to talk about each topic, and are also planning panel discussions on each topic.

## Research Track
We will seek submissions on a broad range of topics related to machine reading and question answering,
including but not limited to:
- Multilingual and cross-lingual question answering
- Interpretability
- Improving overall accuracy
- Speed & Scalability
- Robustness
- Creation, analysis and evaluation of datasets
- Analysis of model predictions

More information will be announced in a future call for papers.
